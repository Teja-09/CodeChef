Explanation

1,2 and 7 are friends. 3 and 4 are friends. 5,6 and 7 have no friends. now,

First query: 1 and 2 : since both belong to the same friend circle, answer is a TIE.

Second: 5 and 6: since there is no friend of 5 and no friend of 6 and 6 has higher strength. 6 will win.

Third: 3 and 7: 3 has a friend 4 who has more strength than 3 and 7 has no friends whose strength is greater than his. so 4 vs 7. 7 will win.

Fourth: 1 and 5: 1 has a friend 7 who has more strength than 1 and 5 has no friends. so 5 vs 7. 7 will win. And since the fight was b/w 1 and 5. 1 wins the fight.
